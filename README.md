# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography
This is final Project of IBM edunet cybersecurity internship

## Project Overview:
This project is part of my final submission for the IBM Edunet Cybersecurity Internship. It focuses on secure data hiding within digital images using steganography, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the hidden information.

### Project Title: 
Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

### Name:
Logesh Elangovan

### SkillBuild Email-ID:

### College: 
Velalar College of Engineering and Technology, Thindal, Tamil Nadu

### Internship Duration: 
January 15, 2024 - February 26, 2024

### Repository Name: 
EDUNET_PROJECT

## About the Project:
The goal of this project is to create a robust steganography system that allows secure embedding of secret messages within image files using advanced encryption techniques. This ensures that the hidden data is not visible to unauthorized users while preserving the image quality.

## Project Components
### Encryption Script (Encryption.py):

Reads an input image.
Prompts for a secret message and password.
Secures the password using SHA-256 hashing.
Embeds the secret message into the image pixels.
Generates an encrypted image file.

### Decryption Script (Decryption.py):

Reads the encrypted image file.
Prompts for the password to decode the message.
Validates the password using SHA-256 hashing.
Extracts and displays the hidden message.

### Presentation (Stegnography.pptx):

A detailed presentation explaining the project workflow, encryption, and decryption processes.

### Sample Encrypted Image (input.png):

An example image with an embedded hidden message.

## Tools and library used
### Python
### OpenCV
### Hashlib
